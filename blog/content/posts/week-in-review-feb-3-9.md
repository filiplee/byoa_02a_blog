This week was about consistency. I shipped small improvements every day and kept the main goal in sight.

**Highlights**
- Shipped the new onboarding flow and saw completion rate go up.
- Fixed the long-standing bug in the export feature.
- Started the design system doc so the team can align on components.

**Learnings**
- Breaking work into same-day chunks works better than multi-day tasks for me.
- A short walk before deep work makes a real difference.

**Next week**
- Launch the beta invite and gather feedback.
- Finalise the design system and add the missing tokens.
