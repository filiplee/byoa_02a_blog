A solid week of execution. The main theme was "finish what we started."

**Shipped**
- Onboarding flow v2 (design and copy)
- Export fixes (in progress)
- Design system doc (first draft)

**Reflections**
- We're close to beta. One more week of polish and we can invite the first users.
- I want to get better at writing these round-ups so they're useful later—not just lists but actual reflections.

**Next week**
- Ship onboarding and monitor completion.
- Fix the export bug and ship.
- Prep beta invite list and messaging.
